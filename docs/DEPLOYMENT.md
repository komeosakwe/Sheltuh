# Deployment checklist

One page to work through before and on launch day. The detailed steps live in
[`supabase-setup.md`](supabase-setup.md); this is the order to do them in and
what to check. Nothing here has run against real Supabase, Stripe or Vercel
yet: treat the first pass as **test mode**, and only then go live.

## What is ready in the code

- Branch `claude/wizardly-darwin-v2c9n2` holds everything since PR #6:
  redesign follow-ups, phone home, Who's Going, messaging (backend), security
  hardening. CI (types, lint, unit + API tests, Postgres 16 API tests, build,
  browser tests) must be green on the head commit before merging.
- Demo mode (no Supabase env) still works; live mode needs the env below.

## Before you merge

- [ ] Open a pull request from the branch into `main` and check CI is green.
- [ ] Open the Vercel **preview** for that PR and click through: home (phone
      and desktop), `/events`, an event page, search, `/account`, sign-up.
- [ ] Decide the open product questions listed at the bottom.

## Supabase (test project first)

1. [ ] Create the project in **Sydney (ap-southeast-2)**.
2. [ ] Run every file in `supabase/migrations/` **in filename order** (nine
       files, `20260925000000_init.sql` to `20261004000000_messaging_hardening.sql`).
3. [ ] Auth settings: "Confirm email" **on** (Who's Going and messaging trust
       `email_confirmed_at`, so this is a security setting, not a nicety);
       OTP-style email templates; password policy; Site URL set to the real
       domain; custom SMTP (built-in email is test-only). If you enable
       "Secure email change", keep it on.
4. [ ] Schedule the daily cleanup in **Supabase Cron**:
       `select private.purge_social_data();` (deletes attendance 30 days after
       an event, old messages and reports per the retention rules). Steps are
       in `supabase-setup.md`. It does nothing until scheduled.
5. [ ] Promote yourself to admin: `npm run promote-admin -- you@sheltuh.com.au`.

## Stripe

1. [ ] **Test mode:** enable Accounts v1 support (the "Something went wrong"
       at checkout came from this being off), create the webhook endpoint
       `https://YOUR-DOMAIN/api/stripe/webhook`, copy the signing secret.
2. [ ] Run a full test purchase: paid ticket, free ticket, refund.
3. [ ] Only then repeat with **live** keys.

## Vercel

1. [ ] Environment variables (Production and Preview), from `.env.example`:
       `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`,
       `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, `DATABASE_URL` (transaction pooler, port 6543),
       `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `SMTP_*`, `EMAIL_FROM`.
       **Never** add `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` (local script only).
2. [ ] Pro plan once you sell tickets (Hobby is non-commercial).
3. [ ] Domain: attach `sheltuh.com.au` (see PROJECT_CONTEXT for the Cloudflare
       notes). The landing page currently lives on a Cloudflare Worker; decide
       when the app replaces it.

## Smoke test on the deployed site (test mode)

- [ ] Sign up, verify email code, sign in, `/account`.
- [ ] Buy a ticket with your account email, then add yourself to Who's Going
      on that event (opt-in form, 18+ box). Withdraw.
- [ ] With a second account that also went, start a message request, reply,
      block, report; check `/admin/reports` as admin.
- [ ] Organiser flow: apply, approve as admin, submit an event with a photo,
      approve, see it on the home page.
- [ ] Check the phone layout on a real phone.

## Needs your decision or sign-off before launch

- **Legal:** consent wording, the privacy policy sections for Who's Going and
  messaging (still marked draft), Terms, Organiser Agreement. Check whether
  messaging brings Sheltüh under the under-16 social media minimum-age rules
  and the upcoming Children's Online Privacy Code.
- **Evidence gap:** if a member deletes their profile before being reported,
  the other person loses the conversation and cannot report it (documented
  as an accepted risk in `architecture.md`). Choose whether to keep deleted
  members' conversations reportable for a short window.
- **Real Postgres:** CI runs the server tests on Postgres 16; they have not run
  against Supabase itself.
- **Real photos:** no real event photos yet; posters stand in (`public/home/`,
  `public/events/README.md` say how to add them).
- Trademark, ASIC confirmation, and the Formspree form ID on the landing page.
